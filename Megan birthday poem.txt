For my best friend

You've given me a great gift, or maybe a great curse
You've given me sense and set my demons in reverse
You've given me mornings of reassurance and love
You've given me reason to stand and strive far above
You've given me fear for a world where you are not there

All of your scars are my favorite part about you



Maybe skip the iambic pentameter and choose my own?
